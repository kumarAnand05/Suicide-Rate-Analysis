# Suicide Rate Analysis
by Anand Kumar
## Dataset
> The dataset used in the following project was scraped from the mortality database of WHO. Do note that the data was categorised as death from self-inflicted injury which had ambiguity about the deaths being termed as suicides or accidental deaths. The data was for 118 countries only for year range 1950 to 2021.
> The scraped data was futher cleaned and formatted according to my requirement for generating insights.

## Dashboard
After the dataset was pre-processed and was ready for generating insights. I used Power BI to genrate graphs and charts.
>  The dashboard was divided into two parts.
### 1. Overview
The overview included a basic overview of the overall yearly sucide rate and the number of male and female suicide rate around the globe according to the used dataset.

### 2. Analysis
> The second tab of the Power Bi report included an interactice 3D map which was made using a custom map shape in filled shape representation. All the ciities are set to auto zoom which gives a cool effect of moving globe.
> I added pie chart to show distribution of death from suicide across various age groups.
> A line graph was also included that showed the total number of male and female suicdes per year around the globe.
