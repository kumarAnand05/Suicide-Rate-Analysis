## Dataset
> The dataset used in the following project was downloaded from Kaggle. [Download Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016).
> Then the data was futher cleaned and modified according to my requirement for generating insights. Futhermore I used this dataset to create a secondary table with year being the foregign key for the primary table to genrate an aggregate insight.
> Several other calculated mesurements were added as columns to the tables according to the requirement.

## Dashboard
After the dataset was pre-processed and was ready for generating insights. I used Power BI to genrate graphs and charts.
>  The dashboard was divided into two parts.
### 1. Overview
The overview included a basic average of the overall sucide rate and the number of male and female suicide rate around the globe according to the used dataset.

### 2. Analysis
> The second tab of the Power Bi report included an interactice 3D map which was made using a custom map shape in filled shape representation. All the ciities are set to auto zoom which gives a cool effect of moving globe.
